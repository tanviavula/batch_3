Write a program, which accepts three persons age and find the sum and average of their ages.

Variable:
		 Name given to the memory location is called variable
Data types: 
	     Kind data is going to store in the variable is called data types
	     
	     Reference :
	     	String, Object, Employee
	     	
	     Primitive : Fundamental data types, this can hold single value
	     
			byte, short, char, int, float, double, long, boolean
			
Operators: 
		Arithmetic 
		Assignment
		Comparison 
		Logical
		Bitwise
		
Arithmetic 		
		+, - , * , / , %

 6 face Dice

one of 1 - 6

1. method with return type with argument

	public int sum(int a, int b){
		return 0;
	}
2. method with return type without argument

        public int getRandomNumber(){
		return 2;
	}
3. method with no return type with argument
	public void printJob(String data){
		
	}
4. method with no return type without argument                 
	public void close(){
		//Logic....
	}

Object Oriented Programming


String:

      String name = "CoreJava";
      String name = new String("CoreJava");
     
      char[] ch = {'J','A','V','A};
      String name = new String(ch);
 
 String Objects Immutable:
       Once object is create the content of object can't be modified.
       
       
 = Assignment                  a = 10;
 == Relational                 10 == 20  // Object it compares the references  obj1 == obj2
 
 equals() => compares content of the object, Object class method =>overriden in string class
   
   
 import java.lang
 
 Every class super class Object
 
 
 OOP:
 
 It is type of programming. That is driven by modeling code(Class) and building unit(Object)
 
                              Every thing is Object
                              
Class?
     Class a blue print to build an Object
     
     

Object?
	An instance of class is called Object
	
	
	Account acc = new Account(1001,"Lakshman",87656);
	
	
Constructor:
	It is special method, The job constructor is to initialize instance variable at the creating object
	
	1. Name of Constructor must be same as class name
	2. There is no return types ( even void)
	3. It can't be called by the programmer, it is called by JVM only once for the Object
	4. Every class java compiler will provide default constructor. 
	5. We can have our own constructor, this called user defined or parameterized constructor
	6. Overloading is possible 

Overloading:

       1. No of parameters
       2. Oder of parameters
       3. Type of parameters
       Must be different
       
 this: When we declare local variable and instance variable with same name, to access instance variables in local
       scope we use "this"
 
 this(): Is is used to call constructor of the same class from the another constructor with different params list   
    	
Methods:

this
this()

OOP:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
